# VBA-challenge

This repostiory contains the work completed as part of the VBA Challenge: a VBA module file (.bas), three screenshots of the results of the challenge on a large data set (.png), a macro-enabled Excel file (.xlsm) with the macro installed and unprocessed data (in the Resources folder), and a macro-enabled Excel file (.xlsm) with the macro installed and processed data (in the Resources folder). In this challenge, I wrote a VBA script that took an input MS Excel file with stock data, analyzed the data, and wrote the results to the spreadsheet.
