# Stock Analysis in VBA

----

For this project, I write a VBA script that formats, summarizes, and analyzes 2.26 million stock trading records over the course of three years: 2018, 2019, 2020.  For development and testing, I write the script for a small and alphabetically organized data set.  Once testing is complete, the final runs are on tthree Excel files holding the records of interest.  For each year, the script takes the raw stock data and calculates the yearly price change, yearly percent change, and total volume for each ticker before writing the summarized information to a table in the same spreadsheet.  From this table, the script finds the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume and writes this information with the ticker to a second summary table.

The only discernable pattern for this analysis is that RKS had the greatest decrease for the years 2018 and 2019 with -90.02% and -91.60, respectively.  Moreover, RKS is close to having the greatest decrease in 2020 with -88.65% but is defeated by VNG with its decrease, -89.05%
