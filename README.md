# Equities Analysis Challenge

This repository includes the Equity Analysis Challenge's files and folder: a VBA module file (.bas), three screenshots of the Challenge's resuts (.png), a macro-enabled Excel file (.xlsm) with the VBA module and unprocessed data (in the Resources folder), and a macro-enabled Excel file (.xlsm) with the VBA module and processed data (in the Resources folder). In this challenge, I wrote a VBA script that took an input MS Excel file with equity data, analyzed and summarized it, and wrote the results to the same spreadsheet.
